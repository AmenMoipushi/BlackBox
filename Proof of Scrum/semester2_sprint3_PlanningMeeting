Sprint Planning Meeting:

The team has decided on which product backlog items will be converted into working products during the sprint. They are as follows:
1 - A command to create a poll to give the students an easier way to communicate with the lecturers.
2 - A command should be created to allow the tutor to keep track of who is in their voice channel for their tutorial.
3 - The function should then create a text file with this information and direct message it to the tutor.
4 - A command should be created to allow for the tutor/lecturer to delete "x" amount of messages from any text channel.

These items were then split into individual tasks and divided amongst the development team.
They are split as follows.

Khorommbi Ganyane:
-Assigned with doing task 3.

Ahmed Kharsany:
